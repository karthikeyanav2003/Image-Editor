# Image-Editor
This application will enable users to import, view, and modify images using a user-friendly Kivy interface. It will leverage the power of Python's Pillow (PIL Fork) library for image processing tasks.

# Key Functionalities
Image Loading: Users can seamlessly load images from their local file system using a file selection dialog or drag-and-drop functionality (implementation details might vary depending on Kivy version and desired experience).
Image Display: The loaded image will be displayed clearly within the app's window.
